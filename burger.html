    <h1>Burger Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
      <p>These vegetarian mushroom burgers are as close as I've ever gotten to delicious meatless burgers. Mushrooms really give them a meaty flavor. I like to serve them on fresh hamburger rolls with spicy mayonnaise and a little lettuce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3> 
      <ol>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 (8 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano; cook and stir until mushrooms have released their juices and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Transfer mushrooms to a cutting board and clean the skillet.</li>
        <li>Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. Mix in bread crumbs and oats, and season with salt and pepper as needed. Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; let stand until bread crumbs have absorbed any excess liquid, about 15 minutes. Use moist hands to form mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, into patties.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry patties in the hot skillet until golden brown and cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
      </ol>
